            Hey, I&apos;m Krystian, a product designer specializing in XR and
            creative technology. Over the past several months, I&apos;ve been
            building tools and initiatives to support the XR community.
          </p>
          <p>
            One recurring challenge I&apos;ve encountered, and heard from
            others, is the difficulty in finding jobs and opportunities within
            the XR space. This often comes from a fragmented ecosystem of job
            platforms, inconsistent terminology, ambiguous position labels, and
            a lack of tailored curation for this unique field.
          </p>
          <p>
            That&apos;s why I decided to build XR Jobs Board—a community-focused
            central hub for job listings and opportunities for designers,
            developers, and producers.
          </p>
          <p>
            My vision is for XR Jobs Board to become the definitive go-to place
            for anyone navigating a career in XR and immersive technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you&apos;re a seasoned professional looking to advance your
            career, a newcomer eager to break in, or simply curious about the
            possibilities in extended reality, XR Jobs Board is the right place
            for you.
          </p>
